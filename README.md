# LookCrim-Curated-Dataset
This data was collected throughout the research project "LookCrim:  Looking at Crime - Communities and Physical Spaces" (PTDC/DIR-DCP/28120/2017), held at University Fernando Pessoa, and financially supported by The Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT). Briefly, this curated dataset provides information about (in)security, crime, victimization, school climate, and characteristics of physical spaces from the Historic Center of Porto (Portugal), based on three sources of information: Diagnosis of Local Security, Diagnosis of School Context, and Observations of Physical Spaces.
